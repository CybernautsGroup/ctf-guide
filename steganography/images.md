## Methodology

The first step in any steganography image challenge is to take a good look at the picture. Zoom in. Look for hidden text or areas that look altered.

## 

## Files hidden in images

```
binwalk -e file
```

## Data hidden in meta-data

```
exiftool file
```

## Messages hidden within the image

By changing colors, filters and opacity you can hide things in images.

One really easy way to check for some of these is by using stegsolve.
